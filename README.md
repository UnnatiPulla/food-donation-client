# 4156 Client App â€” ASE Aces

## Purpose of our app

Our app is designed to serve **homeless shelters and individuals** in need by providing a platform to browse "food listings" posted by restaurants, grocery stores, and other establishments with surplus food. It provides a user-friendly platform where people can create an account, sign in, and browse available food listings nearby. Users can either enter their location manually or navigate via an integrated Google Maps interface to find listings in their area. Once they locate a suitable listing, they can view details about the available food and submit a request to claim it.

Without our app, this surplus food would likely go to waste, as there is no simple way for individuals to discover available resources or for establishments to share their excess food effectively.

## How we use the service

Our app uses the _recipient_ endpoints of the service since our app is for those receiving food, not providing. We register user accounts in the service with one account IDs per user. Then, we store these account IDs alongside the user data to establish the 1:1 mapping.

Our app utilizes the food listings API to find nearby food listings that a user can request food from. Then, a user can request a certain quantity of food using the food requests API.
